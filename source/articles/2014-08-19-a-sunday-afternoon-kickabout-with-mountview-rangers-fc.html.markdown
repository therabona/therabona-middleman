The sun beats down on a heated Sunday afternoon; ideal time for a siesta following a heavy banana leaf lunch. Instead we pile in and trudge on to a unnamed field at a remote location to test out our aversion to heat. 4pm, a school somewhere in Taman Desa, Kuala Lumpur, a field and some footballs.

After months of stalling, Mountview Rangers FC looked to get things going in sunny Malaysia and join the elite echelons of amateur football with the pipe dream of becoming an Oriental Ajax Academy for Gifted Youngsters, honing the powers of kids to supply the region with the best players. The reality is a rag-tag team of boys looking to kick a ball on a field instead of on a court, and a friendly was arranged to satisfy this need. If it exists, there is a market for it.

Conceived by a South African-Indian living in Malaysia, Mountview Rangers has closer ties to Capetown than Kuala Lumpur having been named after a suburb in the city. The team itself is composed of mostly Malaysian boys aged 17-22, itching to shrug off futsal to experience the world of field football. Most of them have probably never had the opportunity, as Malaysian schools don’t typically provide too many footballing outlets while the proliferation of futsal continues to reign supreme. To play on a field with 10 other teammates against another full team can be considered something of a luxury, or an arduous effort.

In this case, the latter. Amateur football teams depend greatly on numbers: enough players who are committed to the cause as well as financial support in the form of sponsorship and/or donations. Money is needed for match kits, ground rental, referees, and league registration, all this without giving any consideration to the formalities of training, coaching, exercise and tactics. Raising the money was tough enough, finally securing the help of less-than-anonymous donors while sourcing the services of isotonic drinks.

4.30pm. The team finally trudges in. An inaugural ceremony of sorts is underway, giving out jerseys and numbers to each teammate followed by a round of warm applause. The beginning of our football club, at the best an opportunity to join the A leagues of the country and at the worst, a grassy outlet. Pictures ensue, decked out in our full kits right down to the shinpad. Picture with arms interlinked. Picture with arms folded. Picture with drink sponsor in hand. Picture with drink in one hand, thumbs up with the other. Picture drinking drink sponsor. We’ve run the gamut of pre-season long before any warm-up has take place.

5pm. The other team has trundled in. Today’s opponents are Butchers FC, a mixbag local-expat team seasoned in the lower rungs of the local leagues. The new season is upon them and they’re in need of a tune-up game to get back into shape, with the Rangers happy to oblige. Handshakes, pictures and warm-ups ensue as the heat cools, heralding the onset of evening as the players partake in a customary lap of the field.

And what a field it was. Barely visible lines, random pieces of wood that look like mile markers, growths of mushroom where the penalty spot should be. One half of the pitch looks slightly larger than the other, the goals lack nets, the ground bumpy and uneven with more dirt than grass. In short, what you may come to expect from a school field. But it deters no one.

5.30pm, we’re ready for kick-off. The referee and linesmen are nowhere in sight; a quick call reveals they’re waiting at a field 20 kilometers in a different direction. Comical as it was, substitutes from each team were readily drafted into refeering roles like this is something that happens with unfortunate regularity. The game starts with a shout (no whistle) and immediately the ball goes careening off the uneven ground, flying overhead as two players come together to head a ball that they miss completely. The scene looks more akin to rugby played with a round ball.

The game is played in 3 periods of 30 minutes with a 5-minute break in between to allow for water, rolling substitutions and novice fitness levels. The gulf in ability between the two teams immediately becomes apparent, not in terms of technical ability but with regards to football understanding. The Rangers may be well versed in the art of kicking but confined to futsal courts, there is a real lack of basic awareness of football from positioning to simple tactics. One doesn’t need to channel their inner Michels, just remember to keep a straight backline and stop playing opposing strikers onside.

The temperature reaches that glorious zone ideal for football. Butchers use their experience to plough forward, peppering the opposing defence with runs and dribbles that are dealt with in panicked hoofs to their forwards. The narrative seems to have set in: clear the ball at all costs and hope the strikers can conjure a chance from an awkward bounce. Butchers number 10, a Frenchman by the name of Emmanuel, takes up smart positions in front of the defence, causing all manner of problems for a vastly young and inexperienced team.

10 minutes to go til the end of the first period and an awkward bounce determines the scoreline going into the break. A Butchers FC striker takes on a defender in the box only for the ball to flip flop off the turf and smack onto the defender’s hand. A handball shout from the striker. A handball shout from the ref. Penalty. Cooly slotted into the bottom left hand corner. A young defender deflated and cursing at the ground beneath him.

First break. Drinks all around, the captain-manager tries to encourage his team. Substitutions are made, not for tactical reasons, but to ensure everyone gets to play. No room for toilet breaks. We go again.

A little bit of energy has been injected into the second half, as a football commentator might say. Smart interchanges between two of the Rangers players sees a couple of chances, but a quick counter and a smart finish sees the leading team go 2-0 up. Butchers FC are heckling their own player, a fairly overweight gentleman content to sit on the last defender and take pot shots at goal. Run a bit Shaun! Try and lose that spare tyre! It takes any ill will out of the game, a casual reminder to all that that the occasion is a friendly one.

Rangers have a set piece. A beauty of a cross is floated into the box, it’s met by a foot, it’s in the back of the non-existent net! The subs bench is elated. Mountview Rangers FC have their first goal ever, ever. The opposing team applauds the delivery and finish. Come on boys lets do that again! As the second period ends.

More drinks, more subs. The crowd, composed of wives, children, friends, donors, and a girl with her cat, stretch out and enjoy the evening. Hardly a break this time, as the sun threatens to set and rob the game of sight. Butchers continue to dominate and it pays off as they take a 3-1 lead. Pretty scripted ending to the game, as Rangers fling forward to try and add one more goal to their little history book.

Not today, as the sun sets and with it the game. Customary handshakes all around, everyone likes how that looks on TV and it feels as good as it should; like a sense of accomplishment and celebration regardless of the score. Mountview Rangers FC come away from the game disappointed by the outcome, as all boys want to do is win. But not much could be expected of inexperienced, untrained bunch of kids brought together by matching outfits.

The idea was always to get things going, to start playing games against other teams, to feel the joy of grass beneath ones boots. There’s nothing like the space afforded by field football, the simple pleasure of rocketing a ball skyward, of set pieces. Mountview Rangers are a long way from being ready to join a league, but the numbers are there, the passion is present, the commitment is cemented. And finally at long last, so is the opportunity.
