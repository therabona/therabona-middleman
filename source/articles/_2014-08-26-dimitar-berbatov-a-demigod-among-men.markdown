Rarely has a player divided opinion between fans of a single club as much as Dimitar Berbatov. The inimitable Bulgarian was a unique player; his sultry ball skills would turn most defenders into motionless traffic cones but where he fit into the team was a whole other matter. It is perhaps interesting to note that Berbatov only failed to assimilate (by popular opinion) into the team at Manchester United. At all his other clubs – CSKA Sofia, Bayer Leverkusen, Tottenham Hotspur, Fulham, and now AS Monaco – the striker was considered a roaring success, linking up play with his delightful flicks and tricks, while scoring goals of every variety. So what went wrong at United? His goalscoring record was similar, or even better, than the ratio he maintained at other clubs during his career, so what went wrong at United?

INSERT BERBATOV GOAL CHART

The numbers alone seem to paint a different picture. Adding some weight to the argument, Berbatov’s scoring rate at all his clubs was not vastly different, averaging a goal every two or three games – acceptable for a top class striker. The highest goals to games ratio of his career came during his time at CSKA Sofia; his scoring exploits would earn him a move to Bayer Leverkusen. There, he became part of the famous Neverkusen team that completed an incredible treble of runner-up finishes in the 2001/02 season, pipped in the league, cup and Champions League final. From there, he would move to Tottenham, before United shelled out a club record £30.75m to sign him. But why did the move turn sour for the mercurial Bulgarian?

It is widely acknowledged that Berbatov should have complete an awesome attacking quartet at United consisting of himself, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. The reigning European champions saw his signing as a statement of intent, while in the first of many displays of his character, Berbatov did not even talk to Man City who had also agreed a fee with Tottenham. His pay packet would have undoubtedly been significantly more than what he would earn at United, but the lure of Champions League football and the prestige of playing for United won him over. Perhaps it was the right move at the wrong time; United had just conquered Europe and their playing style was largely geared to take advantage of Rooney’s vision and Ronaldo’s pace on the counterattack, with Tevez’s work rate delighting both fans and his manager. Hindsight is 20/20 but perhaps there was no room for a player of Berbatov’s incredible talent in a set-up aimed at penetrating opposition defences at breakneck speed and devastating efficiency, as opposed to death by a thousand passes.

When he was made the focal point of attack, he delivered in fine fashion. In United’s title-winning season of 2010/11, Berbatov shared the Golden Boot with Tevez, now of United’s cross-town rivals, scoring 20 times in 32 appearances, including three hat-tricks (one of which was an incredible five-goal haul against Blackburn). Remarkably, he only scored twice in the league after January, but by now, it seemed only a matter of time before he would depart the club whose shirt he so fervently defended on the pitch, even if it was not always appreciated. Snubbed by the manager during the Champions League final, he would not even be part of the matchday squad, with his spot going to Michael Owen. To add insult to injury, Owen never looked like getting on the pitch as United were clinically taken apart by Barcelona’s possession game, ironically, one that Berbatov would probably have thrived in.

To fully appreciate a player, one must isolate him from the system he is slotted into. Critics may argue that a good player can flourish in any system; Lionel Messi’s initial years with Argentina provide the perfect riposte to an argument that may have merit, but is ultimately ignoring the basic gauge of any player – talent. It is no mistake that many neutrals are big fans of Berbatov’s silky skills and classy technique. He caresses the ball with a surgeon’s touch, delicate and precise, expertly negotiating passages of play. This ilk of player is one that comes along rarely; one that possesses outrageous talent, but has a brain to match, sewing together the various threads of talent to produce a silky finish. The combination is often devastating for the opponent but aesthetically pleasing to onlookers.

*On training with Berbatov*

> “His back was facing me and I was 40 yards away, yelling for the ball. Berba dropped his shoulder and, without looking, he played a pinpoint pass right to my feet. After training, he said to me: “I know where you are. You don't have to shout.’”

West Ham at Old Trafford. As the ball rolls towards the touchline, the not so lazy Bulgarian sprints, in a manner contradicting the “lazy” accusations hurled at him from some quarters of the support, to keep the ball in play. The unwitting body of James Collins blocks off a direct passage to goal. Berbatov pulls the ball back ever so slightly with the inside of his foot while simultaneously swivelling 180 degrees. As the ball slows to a crawl, of play, he gently flicks it over the helpless, trailing foot of Collins, leaving him a clear path towards goal. Having pulled off a move of such audacity, he maintains his composure and presence of mind to guide the ball into a tiny alley between the goalkeeper and a retreating defender. The ball avoids the outstretched leg and arm of both players, weighted perfectly into the path of Ronaldo, with a defender hot on his heels. The ball is tapped in, having evaded three layers of the West Ham defence with two of the finest touches ever seen at Old Trafford. A pokerfaced Berbatov joins his teammates to celebrate, his nonchalance only broken by Rio Ferdinand’s blunt appreciation of his fine piece of skill.

“Fucking brilliant!” he mouths to the Bulgarian.

A wry smile slowly forms…

The clock is ticking down. United are protecting a one goal lead against Everton at Goodison Park. A throw-in is awarded deep in the Everton half with the clock at 96 minutes. Nani throws the ball to Berbatov, who quickly brings down the ball and ushers it towards the corner flag. Two burly Everton defenders close him down; one of them muscles Berbatov into the ground and off the ball. Or so he thought. Laying on the ground, the Bulgarian maintains control of the ball with his outstretched leg. Using his instep , Berbatov rolls the ball toward his body before swiftly switching to his outstep, flicking the ball up and over the two defenders while still on the ground. Just before the ball hits the ground, Nani flicks the ball over the head of the two unfortunate defenders with his laces, before attempting to head it back to Berbatov. Everton are having none of it and the defender intercepts and clears the ball, no longer willing to be part of Berbatov and Nani’s yo-yo football routine that seemed more suited for Cirque du Soleil than Old Trafford. The crowd applaud in appreciation…

Rewind to 2004. Bayer Leverkusen were privileged enough to be the Bulgarian’s employers for the first goal that really made the world sit up and take notice of this young man from Blagoevgrad. In a Champions League game against Roma, he collected the ball on the left side of the penalty area. His first touch is used to flick the ball up, the second sees him lift the ball over his shoulder, wrongfooting Traianos Dellas, the captain of the Greece team that won Euro 2004 earlier in the summer. The stunned Greek can only watch as Berbatov expertly judges a lob that goes over the head of Roma custodian, Carlo Zotti, and another defender attempting a bicycle kick clearance. As the ball nestles in the back of the net, the Roma backline stare at each other blankly. The game may have been played behind closed doors, but there was no shortage of spectators in the Roma defence for the goal…

Fast forward to 2014. Despite rumours of Barcelona keeping tabs on him as a short-term replacement for an injured Lionel Messi, nothing came of the move. Monaco came calling, and Berbatov was more than happy to answer, joining the principality club from Fulham. But having swapped a relegation dogfight in England for a title race in France, Berbatov was not expected to do very well. L’Equipe football writer, Jean-Michel Rouet, publicly stated that Berbatov’s languid style would not be able to integrate into Monaco’s hardworking team. Signed as a replacement for Radamel Falcao, Berbatov was well aware of the enormity of the challenge he faced.

By April, he had settled into the team nicely but by this time, Paris St-Germain had already pulled away from Monaco in the table. Going into their match with Nice, Monaco required a win to keep their slim title hopes alive. Five minutes into the game, Nice fail to clear their lines properly and the hopeful long ball is delivered into the area. As he has done for the entirety of his career, Berbatov kills the ball with a single touch, the ball dropping to the ground as gravity takes over. Letting the ball fall, Berbatov sneaks a quick look at David Ospina who is covering his near post and is on his line. As the ball bounces, the Bulgarian helps it on its way, playing a half-volley lob that catches the Nice goalkeeper off-guard. Despite still being on his line, the Colombian can do nothing as the ball completes its arc, flapping helplessly like a painter falling off his stepladder mid-work.

The Stade Louis II erupts, getting to their feet to applaud the glorious finish. The Bulgarian jogs away in celebration, pointing to the crowd before accepting his teammates’ congratulations. He grins from ear-to-ear, a smile not seen for many a year. This is a man enjoying his football. Prompted by the stadium announcer, the crowd responds by chanting his name in unison.

The announcer chants over the microphone, *“But pour Dimitar…”*

**“BERBATOV!”** comes the 8,500-strong reply.

*“Dimitar…”*

**“BERBATOV!”**
